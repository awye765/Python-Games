# DEEPCOPY
#
# When you create a variable you make a pointer to an object.  Sometimes you
# want to create a copy of the underlying object that you can modify WITHOUT
# automatically modifying the original object at the same time.  To do so you
# can use the deepcopy method.
#
# A deep copy makes the copying process recursive. It means first constructing a
# NEW collection object and then recursively populating it with COPIES of the
# child objects found in the original rather than REFERENCES. Copying an object
# this way walks the whole object tree to create a fully independent clone of
# the original object and all of its children.
#
# By contrast, a shallow copy means constructing a new collection object and
# then populating it with REFERENCES to the child objects found in the original.
# In essence, a shallow copy is only one level deep. The copying process does
# not recurse and therefore wonâ€™t create copies of the child objects themselves.
